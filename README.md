# EpiJava

EpiJava is an in-progress Java interpreter that I'm playing around with writing.

A few cool features: 
- a lazy reference binding compiler to avoid explicit top level compilation phases
- a fun experiment with grammar combinators, including the ability to reverse grammars, and grammars that match over arbitary Java data structures.
- lots of other neat stuff.
