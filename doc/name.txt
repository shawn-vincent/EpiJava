Naming this thing is hard.

Current best contender:

EpiJava has several meanings: all apply to EpiJava
   1. On; upon: epiphyte. - EpiJava is built upon Java
   2. Over; above: epicenter. - EpiJava sits on top of Java
   3. Around: epicarp. - EpiJava wraps Java
   4. Close to; near: epicalyx. - EpiJava is very nearly identical to Java
   5. Besides: epiphenomenon. - EpiJava is not Java
   6. After: epilogue. - EpiJava comes after Java

Also spelled Epijava or epijava - all reasonable.
